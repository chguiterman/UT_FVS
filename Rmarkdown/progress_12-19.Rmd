## Verifying covariates

I'd like to take another look at some of my covariates - BAL, crown ratio (CR) and aspect. Since I back calcuated BAL and CR, I'd like to double check their calcuations and outputs. For work done thus far on calculating covariates, please refer to my GitHub project, [Create data set](https://github.com/clgiebink/UT_FVS/projects/1). 

```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lme4)
library(lmerTest)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
#load data
load(file = "/home/giebink/Documents/Masters/UT/UT_FVS/data/formatted/incr_calcov.Rdata")
load(file = "/home/giebink/Documents/Masters/UT/UT_FVS/data/formatted/glmm_df_z.Rdata")
load(file = "/home/giebink/Documents/Masters/UT/UT_FVS/data/formatted/glmm_pp_z.Rdata")
load(file = "/home/giebink/Documents/Masters/UT/UT_FVS/data/formatted/glmm_es_z.Rdata")
#load packages
library(corrplot)
```

Notice in the figure below that BAL and CR are significantly correlated. Their collinearity could be an issue in my models.

```{r echo=FALSE}
#correlation plot
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
#make dataframe with only necessary variables
#all species
cor_df <- incr_calcov %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(DIA_C,CR,CR_weib,BAL,PCCF,CCF) %>%
  drop_na()
M <- cor(cor_df)
corrplot.mixed(M,title="All species",mar = c(0,0,1,0))
#for each species
cor_df_df <- glmm_df_z %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(DIA_C,CR,CR_weib,BAL,PCCF,CCF) %>%
  drop_na()
D <- cor(cor_df_df)
corrplot.mixed(D,title="Douglas fir",mar = c(0,0,1,0))
#ponderosa pine
cor_df_pp <- glmm_pp_z %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(DIA_C,CR,CR_weib,BAL,PCCF,CCF) %>%
  drop_na()
P <- cor(cor_df_pp)
corrplot.mixed(P,title="Ponderosa pine",mar = c(0,0,1,0))
#englemann spruce
cor_df_es <- glmm_es_z %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(DIA_C,CR,CR_weib,BAL,PCCF,CCF) %>%
  drop_na()
E <- cor(cor_df_es)
corrplot.mixed(E,title="Englemann spruce",mar = c(0,0,1,0))
```

### BAL

```{r include=FALSE}
load(file = "/home/giebink/Documents/Masters/UT/UT_FVS/data/formatted/density_data.Rdata")
load(file = "/home/giebink/Documents/Masters/UT/UT_FVS/data/formatted/per_cov.Rdata")
```

Below are the calcuations for BAL. Basal area per acre is summed on a particular plot for a particular year for all trees larger than the subject tree.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#calculate basal area per acre for each tree
density_data <- density_data %>%
  mutate(BA_pa = ((DIA_C^2) * 0.005454) * TPA_C)
#BAL
#sum BApa of trees larger on the same plot in same year
density_data <- density_data %>%
  group_by(PLT_CN,Year) %>%
  mutate(rank_pltyr = rank(DIA_C, na.last = TRUE, ties.method = "min")) %>%
  #min assigns lowest value to ties (1,2,3,3,5,6)
  mutate(BAL = map_dbl(DIA_C,~sum(BA_pa[DIA_C>.x],na.rm = TRUE)))
```

If BAL is calculated correctly, its maximum value on a plot should match BALIVE for a plot.

```{r}
#check
bal_check <- density_data %>%
  group_by(PLT_CN)%>%
  summarise(max = max(BAL))
bal_check$BALIVE <- per_cov$BALIVE[match(bal_check$PLT_CN, per_cov$PLT_CN)]
head(bal_check)
```

We expect BAL to decrease as DBH increases, which appears to be the case here.

```{r}
#visualize bal
#for all trees, all years
plot(density_data$DIA_C,density_data$BAL,
     xlab = "DBH", ylab = "BAL", main = "BAL over DBH")
```

If we look at BAL for a single tree over DBH, 

```{r}
#look at a single tree over time
bal_yr_plots <- glmm_df_z%>%
  group_by(TRE_CN) %>%
  do(plots=ggplot(data=.) +
       aes(x=DIA_C, y=BAL) + geom_point() + ggtitle(unique(.$TRE_CN)))

par(mfrow=c(2,2))
bal_yr_plots$plots[[10]]
bal_yr_plots$plots[[20]]
bal_yr_plots$plots[[40]]
bal_yr_plots$plots[[70]]
```

I think what is happening here is the tree is shifting in its rank in the diameter distribution. The trees on a plot without tree-ring data were back calculated with an average ring width value, while the trees with tree-ring data were back calculated with ring width values specific to the year of growth. It may be that the year specific values were cumulatively larger than the average value, causing the tree to move in the diameter distribution. The shift is causing big jumps in BAL for a single tree over time. The question is: is this normal? We see the same for crown ratio.

```{r}
#can also do calculation by hand
plot1 <- incr_calcov[410,32] #15 trees
bal_check <- density_data %>%
  select(PLT_CN,TRE_CN,Year,DIA_C,BALIVE,TPA_C,BA_pa,BAL,DESIGNCD) %>%
  filter(PLT_CN == plot1) %>%
  filter(Year == 1988)
```

CR_weib <- vector(mode="numeric", length=nrow(incr_calcov))
for(i in 1:nrow(incr_calcov)){
  #Function arguments:
  #SPCD - is number code of species of tree record
  #SDI - is SDI of stand (Stage 1968)
  Species <- incr_calcov$SPCD[i]
  if(Species %in% CR_WEIB_df$species){
    #SDI max values for each species were pulled from UT Variant overview
    SDIMAX <- CR_WEIB_df$SDIMAX[CR_WEIB_df$species == Species]

    b1 <- CR_WEIB_df$b1[CR_WEIB_df$species == Species]

    #Calculate scale parameter
    SCALE = (1.0 - .00167 * (incr_calcov$CCF[i]-100.0))
    if(SCALE < 0.3){SCALE = 0.3}
    if(SCALE > 1.0){SCALE = 1.0}
    
    N <- incr_calcov$num_t[i]
    #X is tree's rank in diameter distribution
    #Multiply tree's rank in diameter distribution (trees position relative to tree with largest diameter in the stand) by scale parameter
    Y <- incr_calcov$rank_pltyr[i]/N * SCALE
    if(Y < 0.05){Y = 0.05}
    if(Y > 0.95){Y = 0.95}
    #Constrain Y between 0.05 and 0.95 - crown ratio predictions in FVS are bound between these two values
    
    #Calculate crown ratio (this corresponds to variable X in UTAH variant overview)
    X <- WEIBA + WEIBB*((-1*log(1-Y))^(1/WEIBC))
    #X = a treeâ€™s crown ratio expressed as a percent / 10
    incr_calcov$CR_weib[i] <- X * 10
  }
  if(!(Species %in% CR_WEIB_df$species)){
    incr_calcov$CR_weib[i] <- NA
  }
}
```

If we compare the calculation for crown ratio and the estimated crown ratio during the inventory year, we get very different answers.

```{r}
#check
cr_check<- incr_calcov %>%
  select(TRE_CN,Year,MEASYEAR,PLT_CN,SPCD,CCF,CR,CR_weib) %>%
  filter(MEASYEAR == Year)
cr_check[62:69,]
```

Crown ratio and calcuated crown ratio should be similar and follow the 1:1 line.

```{r}
#visualize
plot(incr_calcov$CR,incr_calcov$CR_weib,
     xlab = "Copied CR", ylab = "Calculated CR",
     main = "Crown Ratio (CR) Calculated vs Copied")
```

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
#copied
plot(incr_calcov$DIA_C,incr_calcov$CR,
     xlab = "DBH", ylab = "Copied CR")
#calculated
plot(incr_calcov$DIA_C,incr_calcov$CR_weib,
     xlab = "DBH", ylab = "Calculated CR")
```

If we look at calculated crown ratio for a single tree back in time, it follows the same (but opposite) pattern as BAL. In the FVS Utah variant guide, it says that crown change is bounded to 1% per year for the length of the cycle to avoid drastic changes.

```{r}
#look at a single tree over time
cr_yr_plots <- glmm_df_z%>% 
  filter(!is.na(CR_weib)) %>%
  group_by(TRE_CN) %>%
  do(plots=ggplot(data=.) +
       aes(x=DIA_C, y=CR_weib) + geom_point() + ggtitle(unique(.$TRE_CN)))

par(mfrow=c(2,2))
cr_yr_plots$plots[[10]]
cr_yr_plots$plots[[20]]
cr_yr_plots$plots[[40]]
cr_yr_plots$plots[[70]]
```

### ASPECT

Aspect is the only covariate that has missing data (NA values). My current solution has been to replace all NA values with 0. However, John said that all ASPECT values should be filled in the FIADB. Below is a dataframe of the trees (only my focal species) that don't have values for ASPECT. Most trees that have missing aspect values, except two trees, have a slope value less than 5.

```{r warning=FALSE}
#missing
asp_check <- read_csv(file = "/home/giebink/Documents/Masters/UT/UT_FVS/data/formatted/check/asp_check.csv")
asp_check2 <- asp_check %>%
  select(TRE_CN,SPCD,ASPECT,SLOPE)
head(asp_check2)
```

I don't currently have either aspect covariate in my model. The covariate should model the effect of radiation on growth, but I have a hard time interpretting it (see below).

```{r}
#interpretation
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
#graph of sin and cos of aspect
x <- seq(1,360,1)
plot(x,sin(x-0.7854),ylab = "sin(ASPECT-0.7854)")
plot(x,cos(x-0.7854),ylab = "cos(ASPECT-0.7854)")
```

## Building Growth Models

I've already build some growth models for Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, and Engelmann spruce. For more information on the process of building models, see my GitHub project, [Build LMM](https://github.com/clgiebink/UT_FVS/projects/2).

### Competition

As mentioned above, BAL and CR are collinear, which has an effect on my model outputs. One solution might be to reduce the number of competiton variables, since the current FVS models have many - CR, BAL, PCCF, CCF. Below are model outputs different combinations of competiton variables, where:

* LMM: linear mixed model with all competition parameters - `CR_weib`,`BAL`, and `CCF`
* LMM_bal: linear mixed model with only `BAL` as a competition parameter
* LMM_cr: linear mixed model with only `CR_weib` as a competition parameter
* LMM_ccf: linear mixed model with only `CCF` as a competition parameter
* LMM_crf: linear mixed model with `CR_weib` and `CCF` as a competition parameters

![optional caption text](/home/giebink/Documents/Masters/UT/UT_FVS/images/competition_vis_df.png)

Notice, BAL by itself becomes insignificant, and CR becomes less positive.

![optional caption text](/home/giebink/Documents/Masters/UT/UT_FVS/images/competition_vis_es.png)

### Climate

Notice in the above figures that precipitation always has a smaller effect size than temperature. One reason this could be is the parameter choice for precipitation versus temperature. For precipitation, we dicussed using an annual parameter instead of a seasonal parameter, since precipitation is more uncertain in climate projections, especially for particular months. Current models are fit with water year (Oct-Sept) as the precipitation parameter. However, models have the best AIC score with previous summer precipitation. Fitting models with seasonal parameters for precipitation might change the effect size. The temperature parameter is seasonal and chosen based on AIC score.

```{r}
#model here for each species
#df
#pp
#es
```

### DBH

The linear size term (DBH) is insignificant for all species, although the quadratic term is still significant and negative. It seems a little weird because DBH typically has a large effect on growth. One possibility for the insignificance of the linear term is the random slope on DBH. See below what happens when the random slope is removed. Figures also include the effect of calculated crown ratio from the Weibull distribution versus copied crown ratio from the FIADB on model coefficients.

* LMM: linear mixed model with random slope on DBH and calculated crown ratio, `CR_weib`.
* LMM_rmre: linear mixed model without random slope on DBH.
* LMM_CR: linear mixed model copied crown ratio from the FIADB.
* LMM_rm_CR: linear mixed model without random slope on DBH and copied crown ratio from the FIADB.

Some of the effects we've already discussed, such as linear DBH consistently insignificant and precipitation having a small effect size. All other parameters seem to make sense, right?
